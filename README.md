# ProjetSISN
Research and development of methods and filters, within the framework of the project "methods for improving image quality" of Semester 8 of the Ecole Centrale de Marseille.

## 1. Create directories to save the results

In order to save all the graphic resources generated among the execution of the program, it's necessary to create the following directories since the root directory:

```
 > assets # in the root directory
    > aditiveConvolutionalGaussianDegradationWienerReconstruction # inside assets
        > camera # inside aditiveConvolutionalGaussianDegradationWienerReconstruction
        > clock # inside aditiveConvolutionalGaussianDegradationWienerReconstruction
        > moon # inside aditiveConvolutionalGaussianDegradationWienerReconstruction
    > aditiveGaussianDegradationMedianReconstruction # inside assets
        > camera # inside aditiveGaussianDegradationMedianReconstruction
        > clock # inside aditiveGaussianDegradationMedianReconstruction
        > moon # aditiveGaussianDegradationMedianReconstruction   
```
